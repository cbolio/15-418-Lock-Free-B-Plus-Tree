    <h1> Lock-free implementation of B+ trees by Chenrui Shao (chenruis) and Cassidy Bolio (cbolio)</h1>

    <p> This is our final project for 15-418. We will implement and optimize a lock-free version of B+ trees,
    often used when working with large amounts of data that cannot fit into main memory. </p>
