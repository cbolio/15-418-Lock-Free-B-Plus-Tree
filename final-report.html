        SUMMARY: We implemented a B+ tree data structure in C++ that supports lock free search, insertion, and deletion. 
        We completed two different approaches to the structure, one using a chunk-based approach with state indicators and another using a batch-based approach (PALM trees). 
        We analyzed the performance of these implementations compared to a basic sequential implementation and a public lock-based implementation on the GHC Intel Xeon 8-core machines. 
        Our analysis looked at the difference between performance metrics of general benchmark cases, as well as search-dominant cases.

        BACKGROUND: We parallelized a basic B+ tree data structure. The encompassing data structure is the B+ tree itself. 
        The public operations on the tree are the aforementioned search, insert, and delete. 
        Additionally, the tree needs to maintain its balance for strong performance, so there are also split and merge functions that separate and combine nodes as needed during insertions and deletions. 
        The tree structure contains inner-nodes/chunks which are their own structures. 
        Each node/chunk contains an array of key-data pairs, where the key is a long and the data field is a pointer to the desired original data; in the chunk approach, each pair entry also holds a pointer to another entry to simulate a linked list within each chunk. 
        The nodes/chunks have their own smaller-scale search, insert, and delete operations; these are used to implement the overarching functions for the tree.

        B+ trees are designed to be used on large amounts of data, often within database systems. 
        As they need to handle a large number of queries, managing individual operations sequentially is far too slow for the real-life use cases. 
        There are specific operations, like search, that can be easily performed in parallel to improve the overall runtime. 
        In addition, through lock-based or lock free approaches, we can find a way to more safely overlap insertion and deletion with other operations. 
        As independent threads will be working with the same B+ tree, there are many dependencies to consider. 
        While concurrent queries can be performed safely, any other combination of an operation with insert or delete will potentially involve conflicting accesses to a part of the tree. 
        There is a high potential for parallelism, especially in query-dominated situations, but it will need to be managed carefully to avoid corrupting the data structure. 
        Batches of operations will be distributed among threads, similar to the usage of OpenMP, allowing multiple operations to be performed simultaneously. 
        While locality is not a large consideration for this structure, there are considerations for locality in leaf-node traversal in the chunk-based approach. 
        As this involves varying operations on a data structure, this application would not benefit from SIMD.
